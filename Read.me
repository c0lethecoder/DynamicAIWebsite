1.	Backend:
	Python (use the integrated terminal in VS Code for running scripts).
	Flask or FastAPI for building the web server (both are lightweight and work well with Python).
	SQLite (for a simple local database) or PostgreSQL (if you want something more scalable).
	Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost for data analysis and machine learning.
	TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning (if you plan to use image classification).
	
    2.	Frontend:
	HTML/CSS for static web pages, or you can go for React if you want to build dynamic interfaces.
	Plotly or Dash (from Plotly) for interactive data visualizations directly in the browser.
	
    3.	Machine Learning:
    Install necessary libraries in your Python environment:
	pip install scikit-learn xgboost pandas tensorflow matplotlib plotly
	pip install Flask Dash for backend & front-end integration.
	
    4.	Deployment:
	Heroku (free-tier for small projects), AWS, or Google Cloud to host your app.
	If youâ€™re planning to use machine learning models, consider deploying them using Flask or FastAPI as APIs.
	
    5.	Version Control:
	Use Git for version control. Set up a GitHub repository to keep track of your project and collaborate if needed.
