1.	Backend:
	Python 
	Flask 
	SQLite
	Pandas : Best for handling and analyzing structured data (tables, dataframes)
	Matplotlib and Seaborn: For basic plotting and visualization.
	Scikit-learn :For machine learning models like regression, classification, clustering, etc.
	XGBoost :A powerful tool for building gradient boosting models, especially for tabular data.
	TensorFlow: For deep learning and image classification.	

    2.	Frontend:
React
Plotly	

    3.	Machine Learning:
    Install necessary libraries in your Python environment:
	pip install scikit-learn xgboost pandas tensorflow matplotlib plotly
	pip install Flask Dash for backend & front-end integration.
	
    4.	Deployment:
	Heroku (free-tier for small projects), AWS, or Google Cloud to host your app.
	If youâ€™re planning to use machine learning models, consider deploying them using Flask or FastAPI as APIs.
	
    5.	Version Control:
	Use Git for version control. Set up a GitHub repository to keep track of your project and collaborate if needed.
